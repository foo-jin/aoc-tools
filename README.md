# AoC-tools
This project is a simple toolset to retrieve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problem instances and submit solutions to them. I made this mainly for personal use, but feedback is always welcome.

## Installation
Clone the source repository, and then run `cargo install --path .`. This will use cargo to install the project in the current directory. The resulting binary will be placed in `$HOME/.cargo/bin` under default settings.

## Usage
If the binary is in PATH, you can run `aoc --help` for the usage instructions.
